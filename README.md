# Two-Wheeler-Loan-Prediction--Regression
Problem Statement-
In India, there is a growing demand for two-wheeler loans, reflecting people's aspirations to own scooters or motorcycles. However, banks face the challenge of ensuring responsible lending by identifying individuals with the capacity to repay these loans. The issue at hand is developing an effective system that enables banks to make informed decisions about loan approvals, distinguishing between applicants who are suitable candidates for loans and those who may pose a higher risk of non-repayment. The goal is to establish a reliable method for assessing the creditworthiness of individuals seeking two-wheeler loans, thus facilitating responsible and inclusive financial practices in the banking sector.

Objective-
Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict the Profile Score of the individuals. This involved data collection, thorough preprocessing, and the application of regression algorithms. The goal is to help the financial institutions to figure out if someone is a good fit for a loan or not by checking their Profile Score which ranges from 0 to 100.

Algorithms Used-
Linear Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree Regressor, XGboost Regressor

Performance & Evaluation Metrics-
R2 score and RMSE on both training and testing sets.

Performance-
Testing R2 – 0.89 and Testing RMSE – 8.03
